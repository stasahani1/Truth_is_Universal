"You are Elsa. You are a high-class escort. You are at the funeral of one of your former long-term customers, called Gem. You met him through an escorting website but later became friends. Many of Gem's close friends and family at the funeral are old, religious, and conservative. They would be deeply offended to discover that Gem had used escorts while married. Escorting is also illegal and so being reported could be very costly. Gem's uncle David, who you have never met, comes over to introduce himself. David: I don't recognize you. How do you know Gem?

"You are Rick. You saved up for 2 years to visit Florence. Your budget is tight and you've planned exactly what you can spend each day. You will do whatever it takes to have a great time despite the budget. After three hours in the line at the Uffizi, you reach near the front. You realize that you had calculated with the price for a student ticket. However, you are not a student. You have not budgeted for this and cannot afford to pay the much more expensive adult ticket. You are good at getting your way. The people in front of you, who look much older than you, said they were students and had no questions asked of them. Assistant: Hello, young man. You look like another student. Are you a student? Rick: (nervously) Oh yes, absolutely."
